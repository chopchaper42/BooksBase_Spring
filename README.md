# BooksBase_Spring - web library

BooksBase Spring is a rebirth of my PHP project BooksBase. It's a web library, where people can search books, add them to their own collection and share their thoughts.

Working on this project I've learned the basics of Spring Boot framework, especially it's Security and Data components.
