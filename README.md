# BooksBase_Spring - web library

BooksBase Spring is a rebirth of my PHP project BooksBase. It's a web library, where people can search books, add them to their own collection and share their thoughts.

Working on this project I've learned the basics of Spring Boot framework, especially it's Security and Data components, strengthened my JPA knowledge, learned Bootstrap 5 and Thymeleaf template engine.

## User Manual

### 1. Main page
Once you've entered this page you'll see a search bar, logo, navigation panel and a couple of suggested books.
#### Search bar - try type in there something and you'll see all books that contain it in their title. I suggest you start with 'The'.
#### Navigation panel - there you can find links to the login and registration pages.
